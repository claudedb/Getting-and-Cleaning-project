#Script Instruction
To execute the script you must first download the data at the next URL:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Then unzip the file and the working directory; the run_analysis.R code takes into account that the data folder is in the working directory

You can then run the code to get 2 files :

CSV_project_tidy_data.csv - CSV Tidy data file

project_tidy_data.txt - Text file with the tidy data
